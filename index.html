    <h1>Traffic light</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The first system of traffic signals, which was a semaphore traffic signal, was installed as a way to replace police officer control of vehicular traffic outside the Houses of Parliament in London on 9 December 1868. This system exploded on 2 January 1869 and was thus taken down.</p>
    <h4>Vehicular signals</h4>
    <p>A set of lights, known as a signal head,[19]: 3.2.4  may have one, two, three, or more aspects. The most common signal type has three aspects facing the oncoming traffic: red on top, amber (yellow) below, and green below that. Additional aspects may be fitted to the signal.</p>

    <h4>Meanings of signals :</h4>
    <p>The <b>1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs</b> and Signals Chapter III provides international standards for the setup of traffic signal operations. Not all states have ratified the convention.</p>
